This is the HonorsContract for CIS276DB

The server is HostHatch

Running a docker container of Azure SQL Edge (The same as SQL SERVER).

The database is scrapped from NOAA, is currently ~800 rows.

The webapp is the UI and the web server, container the APIs that interface with the database.

The pages and information is delivered from the server, and rendered on server, 
making the Database not exposed to the open Internet. 

Database has a response time of 300-400ms currently.

I have little experience with Web Applications, this is applying knowledge from the class in the real world.
