        <p>Volcanoes are geological features that form when magma (molten rock), ash,
            and gas escape from beneath the Earth's surface. This usually occurs near
            tectonic plate boundaries, where the movement of the plates can cause cracks
            and fissures to form in the Earth's crust, allowing magma to reach the surface.</p>

        <p class="p-2 float-left"><b>Safety</b>: If you live near an active volcano, it is important to understand the potential
                hazards associated with volcanic activity, such as lava flows, ash fall, and pyroclastic flows.
                By understanding these hazards, you can better prepare and protect yourself and your property in the
                event of an eruption.</p>

            <p class="p-2 float-left"><b>Environmental impacts</b>: Volcanic eruptions can have significant impacts on the environment,
                including damage to ecosystems and changes in climate. By understanding these impacts,
                we can work to minimize the negative effects of volcanic activity and protect the environment.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2 float-left"><b>Scientific curiosity</b>: Volcanoes are fascinating geological features that have played an important
                role in shaping the Earth's surface. Understanding how volcanoes work and the processes that
                drive their activity can help satisfy our scientific curiosity and deepen our appreciation for
                the natural world.
